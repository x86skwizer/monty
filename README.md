# 0x19-c_stacks_queues_lifo_fifo

Welcome to the 0x19-c_stacks_queues_lifo_fifo project! This project focuses on the implementation of stacks and queues in the C programming language. It explores the concepts of Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) and First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structures.

## Description

The 0x19-c_stacks_queues_lifo_fifo project is a collection of C programs that demonstrate the implementation and usage of stacks and queues. Each program is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of LIFO and FIFO data structures.

The project is divided into multiple directories, each containing programs related to a specific topic. The directories are organized as follows:

- `0-stack`: Contains programs that implement a stack data structure and its associated operations, such as push, pop, and peek.
- `1-queue`: Contains programs that implement a queue data structure and its associated operations, such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

Feel free to explore each directory and work on the programs at your own pace. Each program contains comments and instructions to guide you through the implementation.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this project, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. The programs are compatible with the C99 standard.
